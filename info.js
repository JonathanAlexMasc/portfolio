The tool extracts results from running load tests on the Blink-Alexa integration test suite. <br><br>For example, after running a live view test a hundred times, the tool would extract information such as pass/fail rates in addition to minimum time, maximum time, and average time required for running the commands. <br><br> This data gets processed using a lambda function with dependencies such as matplotlib to generate two reports - an html report containing a summary of the latest load test and a graph showing the failure rate of each command for the last ten runs. <br><br> The results of the load tests are stored in an S3 container as objects, and I used AWS SES (Simple Email Service) to send an email containing the aforementioned report and graphs."

For the students, there is an intuitive profile builder where you can add things like education, skills, certifications, honors, and experiences. No Q is not only good for students, but employers as well! A common problem at modern career fairs is the number of unqualified candidates who waste their time when they could be chatting with someone else. With No Q, only the students who meet the positionsâ€™ criteria will be able to apply, and from there the recruiter can invite them to talk in more detail at the career fair through our intuitive messaging system."
